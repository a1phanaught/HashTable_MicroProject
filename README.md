# HashTable_MicroProject
A mini project implementing hash table, initialised on Dev C++.

For those who are unfamiliar with C++, you can use an IDE like Dev C++ to get the program up and running but make sure that the IDE uses the latest compiler available to date.

If you have C++ compiler installed and if you're on Windows, you can immediately compile and run the program by clicking on the batch (.bat) file.

On Linux, you can compile the program by running the shell script (.sh) after changing its permissions.
